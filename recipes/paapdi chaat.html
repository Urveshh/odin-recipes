    <h1>Paapdi Chaat</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chaat is a broad term for savory vegetarian snacks. This version is from Nidhi Jalan, founder of Brooklyn-based Masala Mama -- maker of artisan Indian simmer sauces (we love the Coconut Curry). Nidhi has wonderful childhood memories of eating chaat on-the-spot from street vendors in Kolkata. She likens this personal favorite to nachos and almost prefers tortilla chips over the traditional papdi (small flour-based wafers). It's a flavor explosion of tangy, sweet, salty and spicy.</p>
